# Building Python Packages
## What are python packages and their benefits
### Structure

- step 1 `create an app folder`
- step 2 inside app folder create`__init__.py`, empty to initialise package
- step 3 inside app folder `fizzbuzz.py`, create functionality
- step 4 `program.py` on directory level, to use as our run file (sometimes called `main.py` or `run.py`)
- step 5 create `setup.py` on directory level to install package, to describe our module details such as version, author and contact details
